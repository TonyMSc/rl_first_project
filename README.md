# Project Details
This is the first project for the Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree.  

# Objective
The objective of this project is to train an agent to collect bananas in a large square world.  We want the agent to collect the yellow bananas and avoid the blue bananas.  The agent has a positive reward of +1 for collecting a yellow banana and a negative reward of -1 for collecting a blue banana.  Success is measured by the agent getting an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

## Enviornment Details
State Space - state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around the agent's forward direction.
Action Space - the agent has 4 discrete actions 
  * 0 = Move Forward
  * 1 = Move Backward
  * 2 = Turn Left
  * 3 = Turn Right
