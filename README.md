# Project Details
This is the first project for the Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree.  

# Objective
The objective of this project is to train an agent to collect bananas in a large square world.  We want the agent to collect the yellow bananas and avoid the blue bananas.  The agent has a positive reward of +1 for collecting a yellow banana and a negative reward of -1 for collecting a blue banana.  Success is measured by the agent getting an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.
